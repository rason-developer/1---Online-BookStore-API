### Project: "Online Bookstore API"

#### Project Overview
Create an API for an online bookstore. The API will allow users to browse books, view book details, manage their cart, and place orders. Admins can manage the inventory, add new books, update existing ones, and delete books from the catalog. The focus will be on utilizing PostgreSQL for various operations, including complex queries, indexing, transactions, and more.

#### Features and Requirements

1. **User Management**
   - User registration and login (JWT authentication).
   - User profile management.

2. **Book Management**
   - CRUD operations for books (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Books should have details like title, author, genre, price, stock quantity, and description.

3. **Browsing and Searching**
   - Browse books by category, author, and other criteria.
   - Search functionality with advanced querying (full-text search).

4. **Shopping Cart**
   - Add books to the cart.
   - Update cart items (change quantity, remove items).
   - View cart.

5. **Order Management**
   - Place an order.
   - View order history.
   - Manage order statuses (admin).

6. **Admin Panel**
   - Manage inventory (add/update/delete books).
   - View and manage all orders.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.
   - PostgreSQL as the database.

2. **Database Schema**
   - Users Table: id, username, email, password (hashed), role (user/admin).
   - Books Table: id, title, author, genre, price, stock_quantity, description.
   - Orders Table: id, user_id, total_price, status, created_at.
   - Order_Items Table: id, order_id, book_id, quantity, price.
   - Cart Table: id, user_id, total_price.
   - Cart_Items Table: id, cart_id, book_id, quantity, price.

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement JWT authentication for secure API endpoints.

4. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create endpoints for managing books, cart, and orders.
   - Use PostgreSQL features like indexing for improving search performance.

5. **Advanced PostgreSQL Features**
   - Use transactions for order placement to ensure data consistency.
   - Implement full-text search for book searching.
   - Utilize triggers for inventory management (e.g., decrement stock quantity when an order is placed).
   - Implement views for reporting purposes (e.g., sales reports).

6. **API Documentation**
   - Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document the API.

#### Example Endpoints

1. **User Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/register`: Register a new user.
   - `POST /api/login`: User login.

2. **Book Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/books`: Get all books.
   - `GET /api/books/:id`: Get book details by ID.
   - `POST /api/books`: Add a new book (admin).
   - `PUT /api/books/:id`: Update book details (admin).
   - `DELETE /api/books/:id`: Delete a book (admin).

3. **Cart Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/cart`: Get user's cart.
   - `POST /api/cart`: Add a book to the cart.
   - `PUT /api/cart/:itemId`: Update cart item quantity.
   - `DELETE /api/cart/:itemId`: Remove an item from the cart.

4. **Order Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/orders`: Place a new order.
   - `GET /api/orders`: Get user's order history.
   - `GET /api/orders/:id`: Get order details by ID.

5. **Admin Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/admin/orders`: Get all orders (admin).
   - `PUT /api/admin/orders/:id`: Update order status (admin).

#### Tools and Libraries

- **Node.js & Express.js**: For server-side logic and routing.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management.
- **pg**: Node.js PostgreSQL client to interact with the database.
- **JWT**: For authentication.
- **bcrypt**: For hashing passwords.
- **Swagger/Postman**: For API documentation.
